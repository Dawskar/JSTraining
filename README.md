Welcome to JavaScript training!

My name is Cameron Cherenzia and this Github contains the solutions for the applications that we will build during the workshop.

I encourage you to follow along during the session, but you can reference the solutions if necessary.

For each section, create a folder within the section to create the application as we work through it.
