    <h2>Local Storage Vs Session Storage</h2>

    <p>In this exercise, we will build a click counter first using local storage, then a second counter using session
        storage to compare.</p>

    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p><button onclick="localClicks()" type="button">Click Here</button></p>
    <div id="localResult"></div>
    <p>Each time that the button is clicked, the click counter will increase.</p>
    <p>If you refresh the page and click, you'll see that your clicks carried over.</p>
    <p>Close this window and run the application again, you'll see that your clicks still did not reset.</p>
    <p>your clicks are being stored locally, so no matter what you do your clicks will only go up from here.</p>

    <h3>Session Storage</h3>
    <p><button onclick="sessionClicks()" type="button">Click Here</button></p>
    <div id="sessionResult"></div>
    <p>Similarly to local storage, each time that the button is clicked, the click counter will increase.</p>
    <p>If you refresh the page and click, you'll see that your clicks also carried over.</p>
    <p>However, if you close the window and rerun the application, you'll see that your clicks started over.</p>
    <p>Session storage will persist as long as the session is still taking place. When the window is closed, the session
        ends.</p>
    <p>Session storage is very useful when storing user information and decisions, since once the user signs out the
        session ends and all sensitive info disappears with it.</p>
